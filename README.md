 3D Chair Model - Blender Project I’m creating a 3D chair model in Blender, focusing on realistic design and clean geometry. The model features detailed textures, smooth curves, and balanced proportions, making it perfect for renders, animations, or game assets. It’s a blend of creativity and precision — bringing a simple chair to life.
